# SmartLiving
Throughout the history, we keep searching ways to improve our living quality. Or in other word, how to live smarter. And this is why smart living has been a popular research topic in recent years. The aim of smart living can be mainly divided into two outcomes, convenient and healthy. And this is what this application is about. It provides two main functions, each of them aim to achieve one of these two outcomes. Internet of Thing has been a hot topic in recent years. The idea of it is to form a network by connecting multiple devices or applicants together. The advantage of it is users can control the entire network with one single control device. Also, information and data can be share throughout the network. Devices and applicants work as a group instead of operating individually. For this reason, we decide to include a smart home applicants control in our application. The chosen home applicants will be connected to Internet and users can control them in any place with Internet provided.
